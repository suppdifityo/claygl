# Masla E Kashmir Essay In Urdu
 
Masla E Kashmir is one of the most important and sensitive issues in the world today. It is a dispute between Pakistan and India over the territory of Kashmir, which is a beautiful and fertile region in the Himalayas. The issue has been unresolved since 1947, when the British partitioned India and left the fate of Kashmir undecided. Since then, both countries have fought several wars and skirmishes over Kashmir, and have developed nuclear weapons that pose a grave threat to regional and global peace.

The people of Kashmir have been suffering from oppression, violence, human rights violations, and denial of their right to self-determination for decades. They have been demanding a plebiscite under the supervision of the United Nations to decide their future status, whether they want to join Pakistan, India, or become an independent state. However, India has refused to honor this demand and has tried to suppress the Kashmiri freedom movement by force and deception.
 
Pakistan has always supported the Kashmiri cause and has raised its voice at international forums to highlight their plight. Pakistan considers Kashmir as its jugular vein and an unfinished agenda of partition. Pakistan believes that Kashmir is a Muslim-majority region that rightfully belongs to Pakistan according to the principle of partition. Pakistan also argues that India has violated several UN resolutions and bilateral agreements on Kashmir, and has illegally occupied and annexed a large part of it.
 
The issue of Kashmir is not only a matter of territorial dispute, but also a matter of human dignity, justice, and morality. The people of Kashmir deserve to live in peace, freedom, and dignity. They deserve to have their basic rights respected and protected. They deserve to have a say in their own destiny. The issue of Kashmir cannot be solved by force or coercion, but only by dialogue and diplomacy. The international community should play an active role in resolving this issue peacefully and fairly, in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
  
The current situation of Kashmir is tense and uncertain. India has imposed a strict lockdown and communication blackout in the region since August 2019, restricting the movement and expression of the people. Thousands of people have been detained, including political leaders, activists, journalists, and civil society members. Many of them have been booked under draconian laws that allow detention without trial for up to two years.
 
India has also enacted several laws and policies that have altered the demographic and political landscape of Kashmir. These include allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land and property, granting domicile certificates to outsiders, redrawing electoral constituencies, and abolishing the state flag and constitution. These measures have been widely opposed and resisted by the Kashmiri people, who see them as an attempt to erase their identity and culture.
 
On the other hand, Pakistan has also been vocal in its support for the Kashmiri cause and has condemned India's actions as illegal and unilateral. Pakistan has raised the issue at various international forums, including the United Nations Security Council, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Human Rights Council. Pakistan has also called for a peaceful resolution of the dispute through dialogue and in accordance with the UN resolutions that call for a plebiscite in Kashmir.
 
The international community has also expressed its concern over the human rights situation in Kashmir and has urged both India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and resume dialogue. Several countries, such as the United States, China, Russia, France, Germany, and Saudi Arabia, have offered to mediate between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. However, India has rejected any third-party intervention and has maintained that Kashmir is its internal matter.
